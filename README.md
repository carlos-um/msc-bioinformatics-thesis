# MSc Bioinformatics Thesis – Lewy Body Disease DNA Methylation Analysis

This repository contains the scripts, results, and full documentation associated with my Master's thesis titled:

**"Application of Supervised Machine Learning for Predictive Modeling of Lewy Body Disorders Using DNA Methylation Profiles"**  
by **Carlos C. Ureña Mateo** (University of Murcia, MSc Bioinformatics, 2025).

## Overview

This project implements a **reproducible and modular computational pipeline** for the analysis of DNA methylation data, aimed at identifying epigenetic patterns with discriminative value through the integration of prior biological knowledge and supervised machine learning methods.

The pipeline combines **clinically curated gene panels** with complementary supervised classification algorithms — **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Random Forests (RF)** — to reduce dimensionality in a biologically informed manner and improve model interpretability and robustness.

As a case study, the pipeline is applied to DNA methylation data from patients affected by **Lewy body–related neurodegenerative diseases**, including **Parkinson’s disease (PD)**, **Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD)**, and **dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)**, together with healthy control samples. This design enables the exploration of disease-specific epigenetic signatures while accounting for shared molecular and clinical characteristics across related disorders.

For a detailed description of the methodology, analyses, and complete results, see the full project report in Spanish: [`LewyBody_Project_ES.pdf`](LewyBody_Project_ES.pdf) or in English: [`LewyBody_Project_EN.pdf`](LewyBody_Project_EN.pdf).

## Modules

Each module is implemented as an independent script located in the `scripts/` directory, allowing flexible reuse or selective execution depending on the analysis requirements.

### 1. `train_test_split.ipynb`
Splits normalized DNA methylation data and corresponding clinical metadata into **training (70%) and testing (30%) sets**, using stratification by diagnostic group and a fixed random seed for reproducibility.

**Input**
- Normalized methylation matrix (samples × probes)
- Clinical metadata table

**Output**
- Training methylation matrix
- Testing methylation matrix
- Corresponding clinical metadata files

---

### 2. `extract_gene_panels.R`

- Model p-value

**Input**
- Locus-specific training datasets

**Output**
- Trained models
- Cross-validated performance metrics per locus and clinical contrast

## Results

All performance metrics and model outputs are stored in the `results/` directory, organized by **panel**, **locus**, **contrast**, and **model configuration**. The directory contains structured PDF reports summarizing:

- Accuracy, Balanced Accuracy, Cohen’s Kappa, ROC AUC, and p-values
- Locus-specific and global model performance
- Covariate-adjusted Random Forest analyses

---

## Key Findings

- **Global models**: No statistically significant results after multiple testing correction.  
- **Locus-specific analyses**: Significant signals detected in promoter and TSS200 regions of the Adult Neurodegenerative Disorders panel, particularly for **PD vs CTRL** using radial SVM.  
- **Covariate-adjusted Random Forest models**: Significant signals only in negative control panels, suggesting demographic imbalances may affect associations.  
- **Conclusion**: Incorporating biological prior knowledge and functional genomic stratification is critical for modeling high-dimensional DNA methylation data effectively.
